## Description 

This is a simple phonebook application that allows you to add, search, view, edit, and delete contacts. It uses SQLite to store the contacts and a password file to store the password. The password is hashed using SHA-256 before storing it in the file. The application also uses `sudo` to run commands that require elevated privileges. The application is designed to run on Unix-based systems.

## Features

- Add a new contact with name, phone number, email, and address.
- Search for a contact by name or phone number.
- View all contacts in the phonebook.
- Edit a contact's details.
- Delete a contact from the phonebook.
- Set a new password for the phonebook.
- Uses `colorama` to add color to the output.
- Uses `subprocess` to run system commands.
- Uses `getpass` to get the password from the user without echoing it.
- Uses `hashlib` to hash the password before storing it.
- Displays nice exit messages.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Unix-based system (Linux, macOS)
- `sudo` privileges

## Installation

Instructions for running the application:

## Phone.py
1. Run the application using the following command:

```bash
python phone.py
```

## Phone
## Installation to be able to run in the terminal.

1. **Download the file:**

A:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phonebook-cli/phone
```
B:
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

2. After downloading the file, run the following command to make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x phone
```
3. Copy or move the file to a directory in your PATH to run it from anywhere:

```bash
sudo cp phone /usr/local/bin/phone
```
4. Run the application using the following command if not in the PATH:

```bash
./phone
```
5. Run the application using the following command if in the PATH:

```bash
phone
```

## Why sudo is needed:

The application requires sudo to run commands that need elevated privileges, such as creating directories and files in system-protected locations (e.g., bin). It also ensures that the password file and database file have the correct permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
